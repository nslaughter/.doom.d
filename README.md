# My Doom Emacs config

## About Doom Emacs

This is my personal [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs) configuration.

Doom is a handy Emacs starter kit for people who's fingers like Vim (it uses
Evil mode by default) and who like their editor to be fast - speed is an
obsession for the community. 

The customization is managed from the .org file which mixes code and prose and
writes (tangles) the code to files Emacs expects on command.

## About Literate Configuration

I manage this configuration with an approach that has come to be known as literate configuration. Org-mode in Emacs provides excellent support for this approach, which mixes prose and code to make computer instructions more meaningful to humans. 

The .org file here provides instructions for tangling the code.
